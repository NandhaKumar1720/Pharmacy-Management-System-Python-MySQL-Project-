Pharmacy Management System
The Pharmacy Management System is a software application designed to streamline pharmacy operations. It allows pharmacists to manage various aspects of their work efficiently. Here are the key features and components of your project:

User Interface (UI) with Tkinter:
The front-end of your system is built using Tkinter, a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces.
The UI provides an intuitive experience for users, including pharmacists, customers, and hospitals.

MySQL Database:
For the back-end, you’ve used MySQL as the database management system.
MySQL stores data related to medicines, customers, hospitals, and other relevant information.\

Functionalities:

Login Page:
Users (pharmacists, staff, or customers) can log in securely.
New users can create accounts with necessary details.

Main Page:
After logging in, users access the main dashboard.
The dashboard displays relevant information, such as stock status, order history, and pending orders.

Stock Statement:
You’ve implemented a feature to generate stock statements.
The system provides details about available medicines, shelf numbers, expiry dates, etc.

PDF Generator:
The system generates PDF reports, including stock statements.
Pharmacists can easily share these reports with relevant stakeholders.

Functionality Details:

Medicine Management:
Pharmacists can add, update, and delete medicine records.
Each medicine entry includes details like name, quantity, price, and expiry date.

Stock Monitoring:
Pharmacists can check stock availability, reorder levels, and expiry dates.
Alerts can be set for low stock or expired medicines.

Security:
User authentication ensures secure access.
Permissions control who can perform specific actions (e.g., adding medicines, generating reports).

Challenges:
Keeping the system up-to-date with the latest medicines and medical advancements.
Handling large-scale distribution while ensuring accurate stock management.
Managing expiration dates effectively.

Remember that maintaining an efficient and error-free pharmacy management system is crucial for patient safety and smooth operations. Regular updates and attention to detail are essential.
